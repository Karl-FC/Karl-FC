<h1>👋 Hello there! I'm Karl F.C.  </h1>

I am a Civil Engineering student with a passion for highway and transport engineering. I aspire to work on projects that involve providing roads to those furthest from society as well as minimalizing traffic on urbanized areas 

- 🔬 I'm currently working on a research project proposal on conducting an analysis on Traffic flow using SUMO (Simulation on Urban Mobility)
- 🪐 I’m currently taking Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Python and Javascript. I'm also polishing my knowledge on the use of a certain traffic Simulation software called Simulation on Urban Mobility (SUMO)
- 🔎 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to civil engineering.
